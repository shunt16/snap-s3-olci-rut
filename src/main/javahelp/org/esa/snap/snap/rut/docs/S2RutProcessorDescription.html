<h3>User Interface</h3>

<p>
    The S2-RUT processor can be invoked in the Sentinel Toolbox from the menu by selecting
    <b>Optical->Preprocessing->Sentinel-2 Radiometric Uncertainty Tool</b>.
    On the command line processor is available by means of the Graph Processing Tool <code>gpt</code>
    which is located in the Sentinel Toolbox <code>bin</code> directory.
    Typing <code>gpt S2Rut -h</code> displays further information.
</p>

<p>
    Selecting the <b>Sentinel-2 Radiometric Uncertainty Tool</b> command from the Sentinel Toolbox menu opens up the
    following dialog:
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/IOParameters.png"></p>

<h5>Source Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Source product:</b>
    Here the user specifies the source product.
    The combo box presents a list of all products opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
    The user may select one of these or, by clicking on the button next to the combo box, choose a product
    from the file system. The selected product must be of type <b>S2_MSI_Level-1C</b>.
</p>

<h5>Target Product Group</h5>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Name:</b>
    Used to specify the name of the target product.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Save as:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be saved to the file system. The
    combo box presents a list of available file formats.
    The text field or the button next to it allow to specify a target directory.
</p>

<p class="i1">
    <b>Open in SNAP:</b>
    Used to specify whether the target product should be opened in the Sentinel Toolbox.
    When the target product is not saved, it is opened in the Sentinel Toolbox automatically.
</p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/ProcessingParameters.png"></p>
